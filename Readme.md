## Features

- **Simple Integration**: Connect to ServiceNow with minimal setup.
- **Uniform Interface**: Interact with various ServiceNow APIs using a consistent method.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in error handling to simplify debugging.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed examples and API documentation.

## Installation

To install the ServiceNow SDK for Go, you can use the Go package manager. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
go get github.com/DARWSANH/servicenow-sdk-go
```

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to have a ServiceNow account and API credentials. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a ServiceNow Account**: Sign up at [ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com).
2. **Generate API Credentials**: Go to your ServiceNow instance and create an API user. Make sure to assign the necessary roles.
3. **Set Up Your Go Environment**: Ensure you have Go installed on your machine. You can download it from [golang.org](https://golang.org).

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example to demonstrate how to use the ServiceNow SDK in your Go application:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/DARWSANH/servicenow-sdk-go"
)

func main() {
    // Initialize the ServiceNow client
    client := servicenow.NewClient("your_instance", "your_username", "your_password")

    // Fetch incidents
    incidents, err := client.GetIncidents()
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error fetching incidents:", err)
        return
    }

    // Print incidents
    for _, incident := range incidents {
        fmt.Printf("Incident Number: %s, Short Description: %s\n", incident.Number, incident.ShortDescription)
    }
}
```

This code initializes a new ServiceNow client and fetches a list of incidents. Replace `your_instance`, `your_username`, and `your_password` with your actual ServiceNow credentials.

## API Reference

The SDK provides various methods to interact with the ServiceNow API. Here are some key functions:

### Client Methods

- **NewClient(instance, username, password)**: Initializes a new ServiceNow client.
- **GetIncidents()**: Retrieves a list of incidents from ServiceNow.
- **CreateIncident(incident)**: Creates a new incident in ServiceNow.
- **UpdateIncident(incident)**: Updates an existing incident.

### Incident Struct

The SDK uses the following struct to represent an incident:

```go
type Incident struct {
    Number          string `json:"number"`
    ShortDescription string `json:"short_description"`
    Description     string `json:"description"`
    State           string `json:"state"`
}
```
